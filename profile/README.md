## About DecentriTech

DecentriTech currently has `three` employees. We currently have `3` active projects under development, and `3` under heavy development.
The end goal of each project is to provide a **unique**, and **high-quality** service to all users.

While currently our reach is small, eventually we hope to make big changes in the world for the better of humanity. Whether that's space-tech, solving global-warming, etc, we want to help.

*Thank you for being interested in what we have to say!*
